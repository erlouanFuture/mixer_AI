This AI model type or new way of using MLP (with images), is extremly advantageous, indeed.
It allows you to mix together multiple of images without any GAN, VAN, etc.
Exciting, no?
The idea is just to set in training input : random data ; and in training output : the images desired !
It works like the generator of GAN, a bit.

You can use it for :
* mixing different faces together ! Yes it works but it become blurred
* mixing colors
* mixing anything that look like each other
* mixing ...
* ...

Hope you'll get fun ! Like I does !
